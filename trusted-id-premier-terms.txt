NOT A CREDIT REPAIR ORGANIZATION OR CONTRACT. TrustedID is not a credit repair organization, or similarly regulated organization under other applicable law and does not provide any form of credit repair advice or counseling. TrustedID offers You access to Your credit report and other credit-related information Products, but We do not offer, provide, or furnish any Products, or any advice, counseling, or assistance, for the express or implied purpose of improving Your credit record, credit history, or credit rating. By this We mean that We do not claim We can "clean up" or "improve" Your credit record, credit history, or credit rating and You acknowledge and agree that You will not purchase, use, or access any of Our Products or the websites for such purposes. These items (credit record, history, and rating) are based on Your past or historical credit behavior, and accurate and timely adverse credit information cannot be changed. If You believe that Your credit report contains inaccurate, non-fraudulent information, it is Your responsibility to contact the relevant consumer reporting agency, and follow the procedures established by the various consumer reporting agencies related to the removal of such information.


YOUR RIGHT TO OBTAIN A CONSUMER DISCLOSURE FREE OF CHARGE. None of Our Products are intended to substitute, or constitute an offer for a consumer disclosure (sometimes referred to as a “credit report”) that may be available to You without cost or obligation under federal or state law. Prior to purchasing any Product via this website, You should carefully review Your right to obtain a free copy of Your consumer disclosure once every twelve (12) months from each of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com. A more complete description of your rights to obtain or gain access to your consumer disclosure without charge is contained in the "Additional Consumer Report-Related Disclosures" section of this Agreement.


USE OF THE PRODUCTS. By registering for the Product You certify that You are at least 18 years of age. You agree that the information You provide during the registration process, and the information You provide from time to time while using the Product, will be true, accurate and current. We may use information from third-party sources, including your mobile carrier, to verify your identity. It is a violation of federal criminal laws to knowingly or willfully obtain information from a consumer reporting agency under false pretenses. If TrustedID has any reason to suspect You have provided untrue, inaccurate or non-current information it may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement (or suspend, terminate, or otherwise restrict Your use of and access to any part(s) of the Product) at any time, without notice. You agree not to: use the Product in any unlawful manner or in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Product or interfere with any other party's use and enjoyment of the Product; harvest or collect email addresses or other contact information of other users from the Product by electronic or other means for the purposes of sending unsolicited emails or other unsolicited communications; interfere with or disrupt the Product or servers or networks connected to the Product; violate any terms which may be applicable for any particular area of the Product; violate any applicable local, state, national or international law, or any regulations having the force of law; further or promote any criminal activity or enterprise or provide instructional information about illegal activities; or obtain or attempt to access or otherwise obtain any materials or information through any means not intentionally made available or provided for through the Product.

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE PRODUCTS SHALL NOT INCLUDE THE PLACING OF FRAUD ALERTS WITH ANY CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES. 

PRODUCTS VARY. Our various Products do not include the same features and benefits. Prior to purchasing any Product, You should evaluate the features and benefits included in each Product by reviewing the Product descriptions and other Product literature contained in the website.


THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE. In the event that the Product you are procuring hereunder includes third party software, You acknowledge that Your use of third party software may be subject to the license terms associated with such third party software. TrustedID hereby disclaims any liability or responsibility with respect to any such third party software.


USE OF THE PRODUCTS BY A PARTNER. CERTAIN PRODUCTS, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS CONTAINED HEREIN, WILL PERMIT ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS ('YOUR PARTNER') TO MONITOR THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE. YOU AGREE THAT YOU WILL REQUEST YOUR PARTNER TO ONLY PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THEMSELVES THAT IS TRUE, ACCURATE AND CURRENT. YOU HEREBY REPRESENT AND WARRANT THAT YOU HAVE THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF YOUR PARTNER TO SUBMIT THEIR INFORMATION TO TRUSTEDID TO OBTAIN PRODUCTS ON THEIR BEHALF. YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOUR PARTNER WITH ACCESS TO THE PORTION OF YOUR ACCOUNT DESIGNATED FOR THEIR USE, AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION AND ASSISTANCE NECESSARY FOR THEM TO ACCESS AND USE THE PRODUCT. IN ADDITION, YOU SHALL PROVIDE YOUR PARTNER WITH A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE WEBSITE PRIVACY POLICY.

CREDIT SCORES. Some Products contain credit scores. If Your Product contains one or more credit scores, unless otherwise indicated, all credit scores furnished with Our Products are Equifax Credit Scores. By this, We mean that all credit scores are prepared by Equifax and make use of the Equifax Risk Score, which is a proprietary credit score model developed by Equifax. Third parties use many different types of credit scores and will not use the Equifax Credit Score to assess your creditworthiness. When prepared and delivered to You as part of any Product, The Equifax Credit Score is provided solely to help You understand how lenders may evaluate Your overall credit risk. Therefore, nothing in any of Our Products is an endorsement or a determination of a person's qualification for a loan, or any other extension of credit. Each lender has specific underwriting standards, so You should not assume that You will receive the same evaluation, credit terms or conditions. Equifax does not represent that the Equifax Credit Score is identical or similar to any other credit score or score model. Moreover, any estimated score changes predicted by Our Products are only estimates and are provided for educational purposes solely to enable You to determine how future financial decisions (e.g., obtaining a new car loan or mortgage) might impact your credit score. In all instances, the information We use to calculate Your Equifax Credit Score is derived from one or more credit reports produced by Equifax Information Services LLC (“EIS”) or one of the other national credit reporting bureaus. The consumer credit information contained in these credit reports reflects the latest information provided to the pertinent credit reporting agency. Recent activity may not yet be reflected in Your credit report. If not, this activity will not be reflected in Your Equifax Credit Score. In addition, Your Equifax Credit Score may change every time new information is added to or removed from a credit report as well as with the passage of time.


PRODUCT FEES. The Product may be subject to fees (as designated by TrustedID at its website - www.TrustedID.com). In such event, you shall pay all applicable fees, as described on the website. All fees are in U.S. dollars unless stated otherwise on the website. All fees are payable upon demand on a Visa, MasterCard or American Express credit card (or by such other method as authorized by TrustedID in writing). TrustedID reserves the right to change its fees (and to institute new charges) for the Product at any time.


In the event TrustedID offers You a free trial of the Product, such free trial shall only be available if You are a first time customer of the Product. Only one free trial may be redeemed per household and we may refuse to register You to obtain any of our Products for any reason, including any of our Products that may be offered by means of a free trial. You must have internet access and a valid credit card or debit card to take advantage of a free trial offer. We will not bill You until the free trial period has expired and provided that You have not yet cancelled your trial membership. In the event that You wish to continue Your membership beyond the trial period, do nothing and Your membership will automatically continue without interruption and We will begin billing You via the payment source You provided when you signed up for the free trial for monthly or annual subscription fees corresponding to Your subscription plan plus any applicable tax at the end of your free trial membership period. You may cancel your trial membership at any time during the free trial period without charge or further obligation by calling our Customer Service Center 7 days a week, 5am - 6pm Pacific Standard Time at 1-888-548-7878.


In the event that You purchase the Product through a third party, all fees will be collected by the third party, as described in your agreement with the third party, and You should address Product fee questions to the third party. In the event that You initially purchased the Product through a third party, You will pay no subsequent fees to TrustedID unless You choose to purchase additional Products from TrustedID.


In the event that You receive the Product as a benefit of enrolling in, or purchasing, third party products or services, or have the Product purchased for You by a third party, You will incur no additional fees related to Your Product membership unless You choose to purchase additional Products from TrustedID.


You hereby authorize TrustedID (or its third party provider) to verify your credit/debit card by running pre-authorization hold transactions against such credit/debit card.


MEMBERSHIP TERM. Unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Your Product membership will continue for the period of time specified on TrustedID's website. If You receive the Product as a benefit of enrolling in, or purchasing, third-party products or services, Your Product membership may be terminated pursuant to the terms and conditions of Your agreement with the third party. As specified on the website, Your membership subscription may be subject to automatic renewal. TrustedID may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement (or suspend, terminate, or otherwise restrict Your use of and access to the Product) at any time, without notice.


PRODUCT CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS. You may cancel any subscription at any time. To cancel Your subscription, please contact our Customer Service Team 7 days a week, 5am - 6pm Pacific Standard Time at 1-888-548-7878. In the event that You cancel Your annual subscription, you will receive a refund based on the original purchase price and the number of unused months still available for your product.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT. The type of customer service to which You are entitled is determined by the Product you purchased. If, for example, You have enrolled in a membership for which You have not paid TrustedID, You may be entitled to no customer support or support only via email.


FEEDBACK. Unsolicited comments, suggestions, ideas or materials (including without limitation original or creative materials) sent or transmitted to TrustedID (collectively "Feedback ") will be deemed to be non-confidential and TrustedID has no obligations of any kind with respect to such Feedback and will be free to use, copy, modify and/or distribute the Feedback to others without limitation for any purpose, commercial or otherwise, without compensation or acknowledgement to you, including, but not limited to developing and marketing products incorporating such Feedback.


CHANGES TO PRODUCTS AND TERMS; TERMINATION. We may not offer every Product on every website and we may also modify or discontinue any of Our Products or a website (or any portion of a Product or the website) or cancel, suspend or terminate this Agreement for any reason with or without notice. If we do cancel this Agreement or discontinue any Product You have purchased without offering a similar replacement Product, We will give You a pro-rated refund for any Products purchased but not yet provided. If We only modify a Product or discontinue a Product feature or features, Your only recourse is to cancel Your Product in accordance with this Agreement. We may amend this agreement from time-to-time. When We amend this agreement, We will post the amended Agreement on the Site. We will also send you an email alerting you that the Agreement has been amended.

IDENTITY THEFT INSURANCE. Certain Products include an identity theft insurance benefit for active users. The insurance limits are different depending on the Product. These identity theft insurance benefits are provided under master group policies issued to Equifax and its affiliates for the benefit of their active users. The complete insurance policies are available from Us on request. The insurance provider administers all claims, and We shall have no responsibility with respect to such identity theft benefit. Please click here to view the policy summary of benefits for policies providing an aggregate limit of insurance of up to $25,000 and here to view a summary of benefits of the policies providing an aggregate limit of insurance of up to $1,000,000.


CREDIT MONITORING PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT FEATURES. When offered or included as part of Our Products, "Credit Monitoring" monitors Your consumer credit files maintained by one or more of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies, depending on the type of Product You have purchased (e.g, single bureau monitoring, tri-bureau monitoring, etc.). In each case the credit file or files that are monitored on Your behalf are separately owned and/or maintained by one or more of the three nationwide consumer reporting agencies: EIS, TransUnion LLC, and Experian. In the case of all Products which feature Credit Monitoring, the Credit Monitoring You request and authorize monitors the credit file (or files in the case of tri-bureau Products) most closely identified with You based on identifying factors such as first, last, and middle name, date of birth, Social Security Number, and current and former addresses. Credit Monitoring will not advise You if an item of identifying information is contained in the credit file of another person and in no event will Credit Monitoring ever monitor, compare or cross-reference Your credit file(s) with the credit file(s) of another person, nor will it ever provide You with any information contained in another person's credit file(s).


If Your Product includes tri-bureau credit monitoring and You cannot be enrolled in monitoring from one or more the consumer reporting agencies, You will continue to receive credit monitoring from the consumer reporting agencies in which You can be enrolled, or, in Our sole discretion, Your Product will be cancelled.


Your credit monitoring alerts from EIS will usually begin on the day you enroll in an applicable Product. If Your Product also includes credit monitoring from Transunion LLC and Experian, the credit monitoring of credit files at those consumer reporting agencies may take several days to begin.


CREDIT REPORT CONTROL. Certain Products contain Equifax Credit Report Control (also known as Equifax Credit File Lock). Locking Your Equifax credit report with Equifax Credit Report Control will prevent access to Your Equifax credit report by certain third parties, such as credit grantors or other companies and agencies. Credit Report Control will not prevent access to Your credit report at any other consumer reporting agency, and will not prevent access to Your Equifax credit report by companies like TrustedID, Inc. which provide You with access to your credit report or credit score or monitor your credit file; Federal, state and local government agencies; companies reviewing your application for employment; companies that have a current account or relationship with You, and collection agencies acting on behalf of those whom You owe; for fraud detection and prevention purposes; and companies that wish to make pre-approved offers of credit or insurance to You. To opt out of such pre-approved offers, visit www.optoutprescreen.com. Locking and unlocking Your Equifax credit report may take up to 48 hours. Locking and unlocking your Equifax credit report may also not be available during certain hours every night. When Your subscription is no longer active, Your Equifax credit report will be automatically unlocked.


IDENTITY THEFT PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT FEATURES. Certain Products contain features that may be of assistance to You in helping to prevent, detect and/or respond to incidents involving certain forms of theft or misuse of Your personal information ("Identity Products"). We offer several Identity Products and not all versions of Our Identity Products include the same features. Prior to purchasing any Identity Product, You should carefully review the Product Detail Page within the website that is associated with each Identity Product for a complete list of included features and an explanation of the possible benefits and limitations. In addition, You should also consider the availability of information, tools, and resources that may be available to You without charge or for a nominal fee in the event that You suspect that Your identity has been stolen or compromised, or may be subject to, possible theft or misuse. You can learn more regarding the availability of such resources, by visiting the website maintained by the Federal Trade Commission at http://www.ftc.gov. Our Identity Products are information Products that consist of one more Product benefits that deliver information to Members to attempt to help them minimize the risk of identity theft and to potentially prepare them to respond in the event that a real and/or suspected act of "Identity Theft" should occur. For purposes of this Agreement, “identity theft” is when your name, address, social security number, debit card, credit card or certain other personally identifiable information (“PII”) is used without your knowledge or approval to commit crimes or other fraud in the United States of America. The brief summary provided in this Section is not intended to provide a comprehensive summary of Our Identity Products, nor are the descriptions of Our Identity Products contained in this Agreement intended to provide a complete list of all of the terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations that may apply with respect to any particular Identity Product. Please review the Product descriptions and associated Product literature contained in the website for a more complete description of Our Identity Products prior to ordering any Identity Product. BY PLACING YOUR ORDER FOR ANY IDENTITY PRODUCT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT NO PRODUCT IS CAPABLE OF PREVENTING OR DETECTING ALL FORMS OF IDENTITY THEFT. YOU ALSO AGREE THAT YOU WILL TAKE REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS TO PROTECT AND SAFEGUARD YOUR PERSONAL AND FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND AVOID DISCLOSURES OF ANY SUCH INFORMATION TO ANY INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, THAT COULD BE REASONABLY EXPECTED TO IMPROPERLY USE SUCH INFORMATION. TRUSTEDID, INC. AND ITS DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS, AND/OR AFFILIATED COMPANIES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE IDENTITY PRODUCTS AND WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THEY WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR THAT THEIR OPERATION WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. NONE OF THE IDENTITY PRODUCTS PROVIDED BY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT CONSTITUTE A POLICY OR CONTRACT OF INSURANCE AGAINST IDENTITY THEFT AND/OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF IDENTITY THEFT AND OUR LIABILITY TO YOU WITH RESPECT TO ANY LOSSES YOU MAY SUFFER OR INCUR AS A RESULT OF ACTUAL OR SUSPECTED IDENTITY THEFT ARE LIMITED TO THE PRODUCT FEATURES EXPLICITLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT AND THE IDENTITY PRODUCT DESCRIPTION CONTAINED IN THE WEBSITE. In addition, We reserve the right to request that You provide corroborating evidence with respect to any incident of Identity Theft of which We are notified, including signed affidavits, law enforcement or governmental agency reports, or other corroborating evidence, In the event that You fail to provide any requested corroborating evidence, We reserve the right not to provide You with any Product features or benefits normally available as part of Your Product. If You cancel Your Identity Product membership, We are no longer obligated to provide any of the Product benefits associated with Your membership, regardless of whether or not a particular act of real and/or suspected Identity Theft occurred while Your identity Product membership was active.


NO GUARANTEE OF PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. Because of the nature of Internet and online communications, this website or the Products may not perform as intended despite Our efforts, those of Your Internet service provider, and You. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error free operation of Your Product or this website. From time-to-time, technical issues may also result in the unavailability of or disruption of certain Products or Product features. In addition, Your use of a Product that is excessive or in a manner not contemplated by this Agreement may also result in a Product not performing as intended despite Our efforts. We will use reasonable efforts to maintain operation of the website and availability of the Products at all times. If there is a system error or other problem concerning Your Product, You agree to promptly notify Us of the same, We will try to correct the error, but You will not be entitled to any money for any system error of any type except for monies You paid for Products that We do not provide. Certain Product features within the Products may be provided by third parties or may be dependent on data provided by third parties. We may be unable to provide such Product features because the third party will no longer provide the Product features or data to us or will no longer provide the Product feature or data on terms that TrustedID, Inc. believes, in its sole discretion, to be commercially reasonable. TrustedID, Inc. will not be liable for failure to provide all or part of a Product or Product feature for these reasons.


PRODUCT AVAILABILITY. Certain Products and/or Product features may not be offered, applicable or available to You based on residency, age or other eligibility criteria or factors. In the event that a Product is not available at the time of enrollment, You will be notified during the course of the registration process and your registration will not be accepted. In such cases, You may be advised of one or more alternative Products, to the extent that other Products are available. In the event that You are advised of the availability of alternative Products, You should carefully evaluate any such Product to determine its suitability. In addition to the foregoing, We reserve the right to reject Your Registration for any reason. We may also reject any Product order for any reason. By registering on this Site, You agree that We will not be liable to You for loss or damage that may result from Our rejection of any order that You may attempt to place.

ARBITRATION PROVIDES A QUICK AND COST EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES, BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT ALSO LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL.


Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all claims, disputes, or controversies raised by either You or TrustedID, Inc. arising from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or the Products (“Claim” or “Claims”) shall be finally settled by arbitration in the county (or parish) where you live or where You and TrustedID, Inc. otherwise agree using the English language in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving complex commercial contract disputes, who may or may not be selected from the appropriate list of JAMS arbitrators.


This arbitration will be conducted as an individual arbitration. Neither You nor We consent or agree to any arbitration on a class or representative basis, and the arbitrator shall have no authority to proceed with arbitration on a class or representative basis. No arbitration will be consolidated with any other arbitration proceeding without the consent of all parties. This class action waiver provision applies to and includes any Claims made and remedies sought as part of any class action, private attorney general action, or other representative action. By consenting to submit Your Claims to arbitration, You will be forfeiting Your right to bring or participate in any class action (whether as a named plaintiff or a class member) or to share in any class action awards, including class claims where a class has not yet been certified, even if the facts and circumstances upon which the Claims are based already occurred or existed.


If the parties cannot agree upon the identity of the arbitrator within fifteen (15) days following the date, then a single arbitrator shall be selected on an expedited basis in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. Any arbitrator so selected shall have substantial experience in complex commercial contract disputes. Judgment upon the award so rendered may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the right to institute injunctive or other forms of equitable relief at any time in any court of competent jurisdiction.


This agreement to arbitrate involves interstate commerce and is made pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sections 1-16 (the "FAA"). Any claim or dispute as to the enforceability of this arbitration provision's restrictions on your right to participate in or pursue a class action or class wide arbitration shall be decided by a court and not an arbitrator.


Notwithstanding anything in this Section, either You or TrustedID, Inc. may bring an individual action in small claims court as long as (i) the claim is not aggregated with the claim of any other person, and (ii) the small claims court is located in the same county (or parish) and state as Your address that You most recently provided to TrustedID, Inc. according to TrustedID, Inc.’s records in connection with this Agreement.
